Fire defense slugs

Player is a plane/robot, can transform to switch between two modes
Plane controls, sort of flying third person controls
Each mode has different movement/weaponry
Spray water, carpet bomb with water, ice missiles
Message box to show info, robot AI talking via text to speech?
Game goes on until city dies, gets harder over time

City with forests around it
Fire spreads from edges of world toward city
Some kind of fire propagation, maybe cell automata?
After time fire slug things start attacking city
Larger slugs over time?
Maybe can split apart into smaller components
Projectile weapons, attack player not city
